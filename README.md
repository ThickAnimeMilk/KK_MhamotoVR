# KK_MhamotoVR
"My hips are moving on their own! VR". A crappily ported fork of KK_SetParentVR that adds Vive tracker support. The main goal is syncing the virtual girl with a sex doll through 6 vive trackers, but as an intermediate step, a female Possesion mode is being worked on, using the HMD, controllers and 3 vive trackers.

To install, just unzip the .dll from releases into your koikatsu install's BepInEx folder. Make sure you don't have KK_SetParentVR enabled, as this mod is a filthy hack of that one and uses the same input etc.
To start the mod, hold the "B" button for a second when in the free-H scene.
