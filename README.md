# KK_MhamotoVR
"My hips are moving on their own! VR". A crappily ported fork of KK_SetParentVR that aims to automate certain features, for a hassle-free tracked hip experience. May or may not be fully ported to BepInEx 5.

To install, just unzip the .dll from releases into your koikatsu install's BepInEx folder. Make sure you don't have KK_SetParentVR enabled, as this mod is a filthy hack of that one and uses the same input etc.
To use the mod, once you're loaded in VR free-H: face the girl (like in the demo video, if using hip, make the hip face you as well) and hold the "B" button for a second.
